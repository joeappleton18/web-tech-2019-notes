## 1 Specification

You are required to create a **responsive** website or web application that attempts to publicize, and, in part, solve a real world problem. 

This problem could be based in or outside of the workplace. To seed your imagination here are some ideas:

- A website to train individuals in a given technology or system 
- A website promoting an environmental or social cause
- Self promotion can certainly be framed as a problem. As such, a web site promoting yourself, a portfolio or CV could be useful tool in solving self promotional issues.  

The choice of problem is entirely down to you, however you must comply to the assessment criteria, which will be detailed below.


 
#### Assessment Criteria 


All of your work must be original and created from scratch, do not copy and paste chunks of code from the internet. **You** must use the GIT version control system and store your work on GITHub. 


You are **not permitted** to use:

* Visual editors such as Dreamweaver

* HTML frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap


The above are great tools, but it's important you know the fundamentals first. 

You should also submit, within your completed website files, a `documentation.md` file, the specifics of which are explained below.


## 1.1 Documentation

You should create a document called `documentation.md`, it should be no longer than 1,500 words and should be constructed using valid markdown. It should include the following sections:



## 1.1.1 Background 

What is the background to the problem you are attempting to solve. 

## 1.1.2 Wire Frames

Before you start, you should have created low fidelity wire frames for all of your pages. These should include mobile and desktop versions

## 1.1.3 Colour Choices

Document the colour scheme you have used for your website and why this was chosen?

## 1.1.4 Accessibility 

What measures have you taken to conform to [W3C accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)?

## 1.2.5 GDPR 

[What measures have you taken to conform to the  General Data Protection Regulation](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)?   


The following points should be addressed:

- Creating a privacy policy
 
- [The 8 individual rights](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/)

- Adding an opt-in to any forms, if you have them


## 1.2.6 Distance Selling


What measures have you taken conform to [the online and distance selling act?](https://www.gov.uk/online-and-distance-selling-for-businesses)


## 1.2.7 Evaluation

You should dedicate a section in the documentation that reflectively evaluates the work that has taken place. Answering some of the below questions could help you:

- To what extent did you tackle the problem that you set out to solve?  
- What problems did you encounter along the way?  
- How did you test your website/web-application on multiple devices, and what did you find out?
- What informed your design choices?  





# 2 Implementation 

Your problem to solve is a free choice. However, you will need to ensure your solution will be of a sufficient complexity to cover the points addressed below:

**Four Page Minimum**

Your website should contain a minimum of four pages.

**Responsive Design**

Your website should be responsive. To make things simple just consider a mobile and desktop version of your website. Therefore, you only need to consider one breakpoint that will trigger the layout to be adjusted for mobile and desktop devices. 

You will need to consider if you take a mobile or desktop first approach to your implementation. Your choices will need to be justified in the `documentation.md` file.


**Use of JavaScript**

Your website should contain one ore more pieces of javaScript functionality. The functionality need not be complete, for instance, you could create a contact-me form, at this stage it may not submit anywhere. 

 Some ideas are:

- Implement javaScript form validation
- Create a carousel
- Use javaScript to display information from a third party API


**Your website should be stored on GITHUB. You should also zip up your work and submit it via SOL.**

### Extenuating Circumstances

The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer).  In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence.   If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested.  Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.


A summary of guidance notes for students is given below:

### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct.  Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:

### Grade marking

The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook.
