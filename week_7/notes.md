# Notes (Theory)

# Client Side Programming

- Recall: HTML is good for developing static pages can specify text/image layout, links etc. web page looks the same each time it is accessed

- In order to develop interactive or dynamic pages, must integrate a programming language

- Programs are written in a separate programming language e.g. JavaScript, JScript, VBScript

- Programs are embedded in the HTML of a web page, with tags to identify the program component e.g. `<script type="text/javascript"> … </script>`

- Browser executes the program as it loads the page, combining the dynamic output of the program with the static content of HTML


# JavaScript: a bit of history

- Originally called LiveScript and was introduced in the NetScape browser of 1995

- Renamed JavaScript to indicate a marketing relationship with Sun’s Java language
- The first scripting language to be supported by web browsers
- The most popular web scripting language
- Formalised in ECMAScript language standard   




# JavaScript: capabilities 

- JavaScript is 
- Interpreted
- Has dynamic types 
- A multi-paradigm scripting language 
    - object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles supported
