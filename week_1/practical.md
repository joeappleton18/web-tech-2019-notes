##  Task 3 Upload your CV to GitHub Pages

Ok, at this point, you should have a CV. However, there is no point making a website if no-one can access it. Therefore, we need to host our CV somewhere. Luckily, GitHub pages offers hosting for free!   See if you can use the official [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://pages.github.com/) to upload your CV to the World Wide Web.
