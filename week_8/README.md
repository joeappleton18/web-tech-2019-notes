# Weekly Introduction

This week will not only focus on JavaScript, but also certain considerations to make sure that a website ranks well in google.  The practice of ranking a website is know as search engine optimsation (SEO).  I am certainly not recommending that you become an SEO expert. However, when you make a website or web application you do want it to be easily found in the search engines. As such, in this weeks lecture we will cover the basics of:

* How search engines work 
* How to optimise your site in order to achieve the best search engine results
* How to determine which keywords you should be ranking a website for
* How to optimise your website for social media
