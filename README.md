 As the name suggests this unit will be introducing you to the technologies used to power web-based applications. I see the internet as a platform for delivering sophisticated applications. Furthermore, on a philosophical level, I see software applications as a means to solve problems. Herein lies why, the internet from a developers perspective, is such an exciting prospect. We get to solve problems (write applications) and distribute to the global platform that is the internet. Within this unit, you will be learning the foundation building blocks (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that underly all web applications.


 # Delivery Structure

 This unit consists of two compulsory sessions, a Lecture (Tuesday, 11 - 12, Solent Lecture Theatre) and a 2-hour practical (see timetable). To complement this practical session, you will also have a 1 hour support session (see timetable).
