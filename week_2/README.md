# Weekly Introduction

This week promises to be exciting! By the end of the week, some of you, for the first time, would have made a realistic website; as a result, you will gain an in-depth understanding of CSS and HTML.   

We could just dive straight in and start hacking together bits of CSS and HTML. While I am under no illusion that such an approach may be fun. Learning to implement websites in this fashion leads to little in the way of understanding of theoretically what the World Wide Web (www) is all about. To address this issue, in the lecture, I will be, in part, introducing the conceptual background to the internet and the WWW.  


# Practical Outcomes
